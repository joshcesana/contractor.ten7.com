## Welcome

Hello, and welcome! This is a quick start guide to contracting with TEN7.  Our goal is to get you up and running quickly! And to anticipate and answer any questions you may have before getting started.

You can learn more about who we are and what we do  [here](https://handbook.ten7.com/020-who-we-are/) and about our company culture and values [here](https://handbook.ten7.com/030-our-culture/). 


## So we‚Äôd like to work with you, what‚Äôs next?



*   First thing‚Äôs first: we‚Äôll need to run a Goodhire background check. We‚Äôll need your full name and email address to get started, and you‚Äôll fill out the rest. You'll be asked to enter our official office location, so please use: Minneapolis, MN, 55403, Hennepin County. If all is clear ü§û, we will ask you to...
    *   Fill out a TEN7 independent contractor agreement and a W9 using Hellosign
    *   Set up Gusto, so we can pay you
    *   Fill out the Know Your Team ice breaker -- the team will learn about you, and vice versa
    *   Log in to Slack and say hi! üëãüèª
*   In the meantime, we will get you set up with... 
    *   An employee number
    *   Your new ten7.com email address 
    *   Other accounts, such as: Jira, Asana, Slack, Harvest, 1Password, Gitlab, and more


## We know you must have loads of questions! Here are some answers. 

Please know that ‚Äî depending on your role ‚Äî someone will talk you through our process in more detail before you dive into the work. 


### Administrative Questions



- **Do I get any time off? When is TEN7 closed?**  
As a contractor, you won‚Äôt get any paid time off. If you need to take time off, we ask that you give us as much notice as possible, so we can plan accordingly. TEN7 is closed every year on New Year‚Äôs Eve + Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving + Black Friday, and Christmas Eve + Day.
- **Do I get any TEN7 issued hardware or software?**  
Nope! ‚Üê simplest answer
- **Do I get any special discounts anywhere?**  
Yes, you have access to discounts from the Apple Store through TEN7, contact [@dani](https://ten7.slack.com/team/UKEQ8DH9T) or [@ivan](https://ten7.slack.com/team/U02FLV1A0) in Slack to get signed up.
- **Do you have standups? Am I supposed to attend?**  
Standups happen daily, at 9:30am CT. If you can attend, great! If not, that‚Äôs ok too. Either way, we ask that you please post your priorities each day in our #standup Slack channel.
- **Does TEN7 have a Brand and House Style Guide?**  
Why yes, we do! You can find it [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nnrddeZrnxrE_J7nycWva9d42q3NZ6zAv2fHBbaeXHk/edit).
- **What is the correct way to write our company name?**  
The rule of thumb is that "TEN7" should always be written in CAPS with NO space between the "TEN" and the number "7". Don‚Äôt use lower case, and don‚Äôt add spaces. The "TEN7" wordmark is geared to resemble the logo as closely as possible.
- **What the heck is Pets of TEN7?**
We're glad you asked! Pets of TEN7 is a special little webpage where you can find pictures of TEN7 employee pets. We have lots of animal friends, and wanted a place to showcase their cuteness. If you have an animal friend, be sure to let us know, and send us a pic. In the meantime, you can admire all the cuteness [here](https://pets.ten7.com/).
- **What is TEN7‚Äôs contact information?**
    *   Call us: (612) 868-7884
    *   Email us: [hi@ten7.com](mailto:hi@ten7.com)
    *   Send us a postcard: TEN7, 9450 SW Gemini Dr #85756, Beaverton OR 97008-7105

### Time Tracking and Payment Questions


- **Where do I track my time?**  
We use the Harvest app to track all time. Please track your time in real time, as you‚Äôre working on projects. Harvest has both desktop and mobile apps, and timers can also be started from tickets in Jira (for devs) as well as tasks in Asana (non-devs).
- **How do I know which projects or tasks I should track time to?**  
Your team lead will let you know which projects, tasks or categories you should be tracking time to. If you have questions about logging your time, ask Dani!
- **Will TEN7 cover my onboarding time?**  
We know that when we start working together it'll take you a little time to get your machine set up with the various tools we use and get up to speed on all our    processes. TEN7 is happy to pay you for up to a full day (8 hours) of ramp-up time that you can log under the "Company Operations" project in Harvest.
- **How often do I submit my timesheet?**  
Please submit your timesheet at the end of each week. We can‚Äôt pay you unless you do. Your timesheet will be reviewed first thing on Monday morning, at which point that week's time is approved and can be invoiced.
- **How often should I invoice?**  
You may use whatever cadence works best for you to invoice: semi-monthly, bi-weekly, weekly...just invoice us. You should invoice __at least__ monthly. Please make sure that your timesheets are approved __before__ invoicing us.
- **How do I invoice?**  
Email your invoice to [billing@ten7.com](mailto:billing@ten7.com). No need to itemize things, a total is fine. We rely on approved (and locked) Harvest timesheets for details. Make sure each invoice only contains time spent during one month. If you are invoicing for work done in multiple months, please submit them as separate invoices (one for each month's work). Please include a copy of your approved Harvest timesheet as a PDF attachment for the time period you are invoicing.
- **How and when do I get paid?**  
Invoices are usually paid on receipt via direct deposit through Gusto. You'll see payment in your bank account within five business days. Don‚Äôt forget, you‚Äôre a 1099 contractor, so we **don't** withhold any taxes. You're responsible for applicable taxes in your jurisdiction.


### Process Questions   


- **How should I use my TEN7 calendar? How should I indicate times I am busy for others to see?**  
We ask that you somehow connect your personal calendar with your TEN7 calendar. However you do this is up to you! You can either share your personal calendar but keep the events private, or you can manually add your personal calendar events to your TEN7 calendar. Our goal is to make sure we have your availability handy for meetings and project needs.
- **What communication tools do you use?**  
Slack is our primary tool for communicating with each other (and sometimes with clients). We expect that you‚Äôll have it open throughout the day and set up your notifications, so we can resolve questions and conversations as quickly as possible. Sometimes it‚Äôs more efficient to have an impromptu Zoom call with each other, so we‚Äôll do that.  We use email sparingly, and mostly with clients.
- **What other tools do you use?**  
We wrote a blog post on TEN7's tech stack, including a handy visual of our tools. You can [check it out here.](https://ten7.com/blog/post/ten7s-tech-stack)
- **How does `#attendance` work? What are my responsibilities?**  
We use the [#attendance](https://ten7.slack.com/archives/C1LKZENTF) Slack channel kinda like we‚Äôd say ‚Äúhello‚Äù and ‚Äúgoodbye‚Äù as we come and go from a ‚Äúregular‚Äù office. We ask that you let everyone know when you start work for the day, when you‚Äôll be away from your computer, and when you‚Äôre done for the day. In addition to the channel, we update our Slack status regularly to indicate where we‚Äôre at: out, focused, etc. We‚Äôve standardized on five, which we chose specifically to avoid any issues with color-blindness or shape distinguishing. These five are used almost universally by everyone, but feel free to be creative if you are doing something special.
- **What hours should I keep?**  
This is up to you! But we prefer that you‚Äôre somewhat reachable during regular business hours which are Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm CST. 
- **Do I need to use my TEN7 email address?**  
Yes! Please do not forward your email from your TEN7 account to any other email address. Always do TEN7‚Äôs business with TEN7‚Äôs email address. (You probably won‚Äôt send or receive a great deal of email, we‚Äôre mostly in Slack all day long.)
- **What are the expectations around using Slack with clients?**  
All client-facing channels include `#t7care_` , so please be mindful of what you post in those channels. Although, don‚Äôt be too wary; we trust you to post in those channels when you need something from a client. 
- **What kind of project or ticket management system do you use?**  
For the most part, we use Jira for technical work and Asana for non-technical work. We have a ticketing system in Jira, so that tickets can be assigned to you and you can change the status as you work on something. Someone will walk you through how to use Jira in more detail, before you start. 


### Developer Specific Questions

- **Where does the code live?**  
Most of the code you will work with will be in our own Gitlab server: gitlab.ten7.com, to which you can get access by asking for it in the `#developers` Slack channel. We have clients that host with Pantheon, Acquia and platform.sh, so each will have their own setup.
- **How do I make changes?**  
We use the [git flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) branching model, and use feature branches extensively. Your code will always be reviewed by another set of eyes before it goes live. And we expect that you will spend time reviewing code from others as well. This is how we all learn!
- **How do I get my code live?**  
Getting your code live is usually a mix of finishing a feature branch, pushing the code into the develop branch, and then doing a release to the main branch. You probably won‚Äôt be responsible for doing releases to main.
