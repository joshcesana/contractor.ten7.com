# Process Questions   


- **How should I use my TEN7 calendar? How should I indicate times I am busy for others to see?**  
We ask that you somehow connect your personal calendar with your TEN7 calendar. However you do this is up to you! You can either share your personal calendar but keep the events private, or you can manually add your personal calendar events to your TEN7 calendar. Our goal is to make sure we have your availability handy for meetings and project needs.
- **What communication tools do you use?**  
Slack is our primary tool for communicating with each other (and sometimes with clients). We expect that you’ll have it open throughout the day and set up your notifications, so we can resolve questions and conversations as quickly as possible. Sometimes it’s more efficient to have an impromptu Zoom call with each other, so we’ll do that.  We use email sparingly, and mostly with clients.
- **What other tools do you use?**  
We wrote a blog post on TEN7's tech stack, including a handy visual of our tools. You can [check it out here.](https://ten7.com/blog/post/ten7s-tech-stack)
- **How does `#attendance` work? What are my responsibilities?**  
We use the [#attendance](https://ten7.slack.com/archives/C1LKZENTF) Slack channel kinda like we’d say “hello” and “goodbye” as we come and go from a “regular” office. We ask that you let everyone know when you start work for the day, when you’ll be away from your computer, and when you’re done for the day. In addition to the channel, we update our Slack status regularly to indicate where we’re at: out, focused, etc. We’ve standardized on five, which we chose specifically to avoid any issues with color-blindness or shape distinguishing. These five are used almost universally by everyone, but feel free to be creative if you are doing something special.
- **What hours should I keep?**  
This is up to you! But we prefer that you’re somewhat reachable during regular business hours which are Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm CST. 
- **Do I need to use my TEN7 email address?**  
Yes! Please do not forward your email from your TEN7 account to any other email address. Always do TEN7’s business with TEN7’s email address. (You probably won’t send or receive a great deal of email, we’re mostly in Slack all day long.) Be sure to add your Google profile photo when you first log in.
- **What are the expectations around using Slack with clients?**  
All client-facing channels include `#t7care_` , so please be mindful of what you post in those channels. Although, don’t be too wary; we trust you to post in those channels when you need something from a client. 
- **What kind of project or ticket management system do you use?**  
For the most part, we use Jira for technical work and Asana for non-technical work. We have a ticketing system in Jira, so that tickets can be assigned to you and you can change the status as you work on something. Someone will walk you through how to use Jira in more detail, before you start.
